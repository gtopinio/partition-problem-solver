The Partition Problem Solver

## Group Members:

## Description:
This program solves the partition problem using the brute force method. The partition problem is a problem where you are given a set of integers and you are tasked to find a partitioning of the set into two subsets such that the sum of the integers in the first subset is equal to the sum of the integers in the second subset. If there are no such partitionings, then the program should produce a message saying so.

## Usage:
1. Make sure to have the "input.txt" file in the same directory as this program.
2. Run the program to solve the partition problem.
3. The program will read the integers from the "input.txt" file and display the result.

**Note:** Ensure that there is no extra newline at the end of the "input.txt" file for the program to work correctly.
